# ML Repo

This repo contains a sample Linear Regression Model. It is a part of the PB ML project.

`train.py` is the script that trains the model. It gets inputs from the warehouse, trains on them and saves the trained model in project output folder.

`predict.py` is the script that loads the model and predicts on the input data.

`data_loader.py` provides helper functions to load data from warehouse.
